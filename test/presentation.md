<!-- .slide: data-state="darker7" data-background="images/bg-openui5.jpg" -->
Note: SAPUI5 was free, but closed

But developers at SAP are open source fans

And the community pushed for it

December 2013: OpenUI5 is born

October 2014: Source is on Github



# OpenUI5 is Open

Note: OpenUI5 is an Open Source JavaScript UI framework. OpenUI5 lets you build responsive enterprise-ready web applications.

It’s based on JavaScript and open standards, using JQuery as its foundation

It eases your development with a client-side HTML5 rendering library including a rich set of controls and supports data binding to different models (JSON, XML and OData)."
